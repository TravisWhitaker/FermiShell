ChemTerm
========

Retrieve, compare, calculate, analyze, graph, simulate, and experiment with chemical data.

---

ChemTerm is an interactive shell designed to allow for straightforward, computational, simulatory, and scriptable modelling and analysis of chemical states and systems. It can draw from an extensive built-in database of chemical data, or query Wolfram|Alpha for even more information. ChemTerm is written in C and compiled with LLVM/Clang. It has extensive documentation written in LaTeX. ChemTerm is released under the terms of the MIT license, the full terms of which may be found in the file "LICENSE."

What can ChemTerm do?
=====================
- Retrieve data and statistics. What is the most common isotope of Plutonium? What are the potential oxidation states of Technetium? What is the specific heat capacity of Aluminium? ChemTerm    allows you to script access to it's built-in periodic, polyatomic ion, and CCC tables, as well as Wolfram|Alpha.
- Compare and contrast electronegativities, ionization energies, solubilities, free energy states, and oxidation/reduction states. What salt must be used to extract pure Copper from CuSO4? What is the best solvent for extracting caffeine from Jolt™?
- Calculate rates, limiting-reagents, molarities, molalities, free energies, and cell potentials. Wnat to build your own MacBook Pro battery? What metals and salts should you use for the correct voltage? How much sugar can you dissolve in your 90°C coffee?
- Analyze theoretical chemical systems with support for many common reactions, including electrochemical cells. Test hypotheses and verify the range and accuracy of experimental data.
- Graph your data alongside theoretical means and extremes. Make powerful comparisons and gain more insight into experimental results and errors.
- Simulate experiments with your own specified parameters. Gain insight into your potential data before and during your time in the lab.
- Experiment with chemicals outside of your kit. Don't have access to nuclear-grade equipment? Conduct titrations with salts of Plutonium. Don't have an ISO 8 cleanroom? Thermodynamially optimize the growth of silicon substrates.
